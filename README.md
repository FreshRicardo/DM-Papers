# Paper Collection of Data Mining with Mind Maps


This is a collection of research and review papers of dada mining that I have read. As a new comer, I made a mind map in regard to each paper in order to absorb the structure and knowledge well. Each paper is attached with a mind map which depicts the logic and thoughts for recall and comprehension. The Papers are sorted by time.
